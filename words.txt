ABSTRACT 

The efficiency of coupling between semiconductor laser LD and single-mode optical fiber SMF was increased by 
a  microlens of  an  appropriate  focal  length  placed  between  laser  and  fiber.  ZEMAX  software  was  used  to  optimize  the 
design of an optical system. The employed coupling system composed LD of 1.55 μm wavelength, achromatic doublet 
microlens and single-mode fiber, thermalized over the temperature range (243-343K). Main source causing the coupling 
loss  have  studied,  these  are  misalignment  during  adjusting  and  fixing  the  position  of  fiber  referring  to  the  axial 
misalignment,  lateral  misalignment,  angular  misalignment  error  (tilt)  and  lateral  and  angular  misalignment  to  gather 
.Achromatic doublet microlens of different types of glass material were selected. Significant coupling efficiency (95.5%) 
has been obtained for N-BAK4, N-SF10 microlens of radius of curvature 7.00900, -6.67800 μm, respectively. The effect of 
varying the field of view angle over the range (0-9o) on the coupling efficiency was taken into account. Coma, astigmatism 
and spherical aberration were observed. Results shows that the misalignment error proves to be the predominant factor that 
affects the coupling scheme with precise adjusting accuracy relaxed misalignment tolerances should be employed in the 
coupling system. 
 
Keywords: laser, fiber, coupling efficiency, microlens technique. 
 
1. INTRODUCTION 

Fundamentals,  method,  results  and  discussions 

an 

power 

efficient 

coupling 

The  optical  fiber  and  fiber  sensor  are  novel 
sensors which develop very fast during the recent decades. 
They have been widely applied in many applications due 
to  their  durability,  multiplexing  capabilities,  small  size, 
wide bandth, ability to carry data in big size and electro-
magnetic immunity [1]. Much attention is being given to 
the  low-loss  single  mode  fiber  in  the  field  of  optical 
communication  because  of  its  very  high  bandwidth, 
making it a suitably long haul medium for large-capacity 
transmission  systems  [2].  In  order  to  utilize  fully  this 
capacity, 
between 
semiconductor  laser  and  single-mode  fiber  is  necessary 
[2].  The  matching  between  characteristic  parameters  of 
light  source  and  optical  fiber  should  be  concerned  when 
they  are  combined  for  higher  coupling  efficiency. 
Generally  the  characteristic  parameters  of  optical  fiber 
include  the  core  diameter,  NA  (numerical  aperture)  and 
cut-off  wavelength,  while  the  parameters  of  light  source 
comprise the light-emitting area and beam divergence [1]. 
Quantitatively  evaluating  the  impacts  of  the  factors  can 
help  researchers  better  understand  the  contribution  of 
every  factor  thus  they  can  optimize  the  parameters  and 
adjust  the  coupling  system  components  more  precisely 
with  less  misalignment  errors.  Coupling  of  laser  diode 
output into optical fiber can be achieved either directly in 
what is known as butt or direct coupling or using coupling 
optical systems such as lenses or fiber tapers [1]. A simple 
butt-joint method gives poor coupling efficiency, typically 
of the order of 10% because of mismatch of the laser and 
fiber fields [2]. In this article coupling system from laser 
diode  to  optical  fiber  using  single  focusing  lens  is 
established. Factors which might affect the efficiency are 
analyzed by theoretical study and simulation confirmation. 

 
are detailed [1]. 
 
2. THEORETICAL BASIS 
 
A. Coupling theory 

According to mode coupling theory, the coupling 
from  laser  diode  to  optical  fiber  is  the  mode  matching 
between  them.  The  direct  coupling  is  found  to  be 
inefficient  (5-20%)  due  to  the  mismatching  between  the 
laser diode and the fiber mode field [1]. 
 

 
(1) 
This is the coupling efficiency between Gaussian 
elliptical beam and a monomode fiber of spot size Wf [2]. 
For  a  circular  beam  Wox=Woyand  Rx  (z)  =  Ry  (z)  it  is 
follows that  
 

 

 

This is the coupling efficiency between Gaussian 
elliptical beam and a monomode fiber of spot size Wf [2]. 
For a circular beam Wx=Wyand Rx (z) = Ry (z) it is follows 
that  

Where  w(z)  and  wf  is  the  spot  size of the  beam 
and  fiber  respectively  ,k  is  the  wavenumber  Rx(z)  and 
Ry(z)  are  the  curvature  of  the  wavefronts  of  diffracted 
beam with respect to x and y direction as a function of z 
(separation from the laser)

B- Factors analysis 

There  are  several  factors  that  might  affect  the 
coupling efficiency. By analyzing them and work out the 
tolerance range of l dB loss, the efficiency C is supposed 
to be evaluated from the in equation below [1]: 
 

 
We can get the C as below: C 
 
(1) Misalignment tolerance 

 

 95 %. 

The  process  of  establishing  coupling  system  is 
associated  with  three  kinds  of  misalignment  regarding 
axial, lateral and angular misalignment. 
 
(a) Axial misalignment 

As  shown  in Figure-1,  the  axial  misalignment  S 
indicates  the  distance  between  the  beam  waist  and  the 
fiber tip. 
 

 

 

Figure-1. Axial misalignment. 

 

When  the  axial  misalignment  is  considered,  the 

coupling loss is given by: 
 

 

 
We  can  infer  from  Equation  (4)  that  coupling 
efficiency 
influenced  by  axial 
misalignment.  Nevertheless,  large  axial  misalignment 
leads  to  oversize  beam  spot,  which  might  bring  in 
additional coupling loss [1]. 

is  not  markedly 

Where: L is the axial misalignment of the beam 

waist and W is the spot size of light beam. 
 
(b) Lateral misalignment 

Figure-2  shows  that  the  lateral  misalignment  is 
the displacement that light spot from the fiber core at the 
perpendicular facet of the fiber tip [1].  
 

 

Figure-2. Lateral misalignment. 

 

The coupling loss caused by lateral misalignment 

is given by: 
 

 

 
Where: xL is the misalignment of the single-mode fiber. 

It can be indicated from Equation (5) the coupling 

efficiency is very sensitive to lateral misalignment.  
 
(c) Angular misalignment 

As shown in Figure-3, the angular misalignment 
Θ is the angle from the beam axis and the fiber axis. This 
displacement leads to the increasing of incident angle and 
causes coupling loss due to the mismatching of NA [1].

The 

coupling 
misalignment is given by: 
 

 

 
Where:  Θ  is  the  angular  misalignment  and  λ  is  the  laser 
diode emission wavelength. 

With some calculation it can be inferred that the 
coupling  efficiency  is  also  very  sensitive  to  angular 
displacement. 
 
(2) Thermal effect  

Frequently,  optical  system  must  perform  over  a 
wide temperature range. Due to the thermal expansion and 
the change of the index of refraction of the lens material 
with  temperature,  the  performance  of  the  system  is 
affected.  This  is  especially  pronounced  in  the  infrared 
region, where most materials suffer from a high dn/dt, the 
change  of  index  with  temperature.  To  maintain  an 
acceptable image quality, in many cases refocusing will be 
necessary.  This  can  be  accomplished  mechanically  or 
optically.  Specially,  the  mechanical  adjustment  can  be 
done manually or by other means, such as feedback servo 
systems  and  others.  Optically,  the  compensation  can  be 
achieved  by  selecting  suitable  optical  materials  and 
element powers [3, 5]. 

The changing parameters of a lens in housing are 

the following [3, 5]:

Field of view (FOV) is one of the specifications 
for  an  optical  system.  It  is  the  angular  measure  of  the 
volume of space within which the system can respond to 
the presence of a target, and it is determined by the field 
stop. FOV is not related to the size of the AS or the EP; it 
depends on the linear dimension (dƒ) of the field stop and 
on  the  effective  focal  length  f  of  the  imager  from  the 
objective to the detector. If FOV is a small angle, [7]:

3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS 
 
A .Simulation and experiment 

In order to confirm the impacts of the mentioned 
factors  that  might  have  an  influence  on  the  coupling 
efficiency, a system composed of laser diode, double lens 
and  optical  fiber  is  employed  in  this  research.  The  laser 
beam spot diameter is 3mm with zero divergence angles, 
and the wavelength λ is 1.55µm. Numerical aperture of the 
fiber  is  0.14;  the  core  and  cladding  diameter  are  8.3µm 
and 125µm. The focal length of the double lens is 20mm. 
During  the  alignment  of  the  laser  beam  transmitting,  the 
system continuously measures the output power at the free 
end  of  the  fiber  to  determine  the  coupling  efficiency. 
Meanwhile we use the optics simulation software ZEMAX 
to  simulate  the  coupling  system.  According  to  the 
parameters mentioned above, we set the ZEMAX as below 
in Table-2:

Furthermore the X, Y, Z position and Tilt in the 
settings could be designed to simulate the axial, lateral and

We  see  that  in  simulation  the  axial  offset  has 
larger  tolerance  while  the  experimental  result  is  more 
restricted.  Some  other  loss  during  coupling  like  light 
reflecting in real experiment could explain this. The graph

The experiment data shows a severe decline since 
in  the  practical  experiment  angular  misalignment  would 
bring  in  additional  lateral  offset.  In  Fig.7  the  coupling 
efficiency  declines  to  51.1%  when  the  angular  offset 
arrives  2.2°  and  misalignment  tolerance  is  0.1°  for-
0.2029dB coupling loss. 

Likewise,  we  have  studied  the  lateral  and  the 
angular misalignment. The effect of combination of lateral 
and angular misalignment on the coupling efficiency. The 
result shows  this  as  the lateral  misalignment and angular 
misalignment increased, the coupling efficiency decreased 
for  all  value  of  tilt  (0.2-0.3o)  also  it  is  clear  that  as  the 
value  increased  the  coupling  efficiency  will  decreased. 
The  effect  of  combination  of 
lateral  and  angular 
misalignment on the coupling efficiency is larger than the 
effect  of 
lateral  misalignment  or  angular 
misalignment as show in Figure-8.

Figure-8. Effect of lateral and angular misalignment. 

 

 

The  effect  of  environment  temperature  in  the 
range (-20-70oC) on the performance of the lens coupling 
design was also studied .The perfect system with all losses 
(i.e. tilt = lateral = axial = 0) were selected, then a change 
in  the  temperature  of  the  environment  was  done.  From 
Figure-9, it is shown that as the environment temperature 
increased, the coupling efficiency decreased, this behavior 
belong to the variation of optical design editor parameter 
(radius of curvature, thickness, focal length) of the optical 
elements (lenses) in the design so all the result change and 
quality analysis parameter values changed also.

Finally,  the  effect  of  field  of  view  within  the 
range  (0o-9o)  on  the  power  coupling  efficiency  was 
investigated. Figure-10 show the effect of field of view on 
power coupling and we can noted that coupling efficiency 
decreasing exponential when the field of view increasing.

B. DISCUSSIONS  

According to the analysis above, it is found that a 
coupled  lens  improves  the  coupling  efficiency  and  it  is 
more stable than a non-lensed fiber. A LD-SMF coupling 
efficiency of 95% is achieved with for N-BAK4, N-SF10 
microlens  of  radius  of  curvature  7.00900,  -6.67800  mm. 
The  lateral  offset  tolerance  is  more  important  in  laser 
diode  module  fabrication  than  the  angular  misalignment 
tolerance.  A  degradation  in  coupling  efficiency  as  the 
temperature  increased  (243-343K),  the  dependence  of 
coupling efficiency on wavelength at the optimal working 
parameters is depicted. 

The  results  shown  that  the  lateral  misalignment 
tolerance  is  more  important  in  laser  diode  module 
fabrication  than  the  angular  misalignment  tolerance. 
However,  it  is  important  to  note  that  the  angular 
misalignment  tolerances  cause  no  problem  in  laser  diode 
fabrication  and  construction  processes,  because 
the 
angular misalignment of the light beam can compensate by 
adjusting the other lens during the assembling process. 

Further, the influence of environment temperature 
over  the  range  (243-343K)  on  coupling  efficiency  and 
other  contribution  factors  which  affect  the  coupling  are 
analyzed  and  their  tolerance  has  been  worked  out.  The 
coupling  efficiency  would  escalate  as  the  temperature 
deceases in a certain range. 

Finally  the  effect  of  varying  the  field  of  view 
angle  (0-9o)  on  the  coupling  efficiency  also  investigated. 
Results  illustrate  that  increasing  the  field  of  view  angle 
will decrease the coupling efficiency. 
 
4. CONCLUSIONS 

In this paper, the coupling optics in case of laser 
diode  into  optical  fiber  via  an  achromatic  doublet 
microlens  simulated  while  related  experiments  are  also 
done to optimize the parameter of the components in the 
system.  Possible  factors  which  cause  loss  and  affect  the 
coupling  efficiency  are  analyzed  and  confirmed  by 
experiments.  According
